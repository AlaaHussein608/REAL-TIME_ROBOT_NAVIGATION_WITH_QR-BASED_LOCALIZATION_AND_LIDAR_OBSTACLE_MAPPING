# REAL-TIME_ROBOT_NAVIGATION_WITH_QR-BASED_LOCALIZATION_AND_LIDAR_OBSTACLE_MAPPING
This project implements a real-time navigation stack for a differential-drive robot. It combines precise pose estimation from ArUco markers fused with an IMU via a Kalman filter, with a LIDAR-based obstacle avoidance system, using a Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) variant for path planning for safe indoor navigation.
